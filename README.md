One of the key benefits of your Hiring app is that it enables HR teams to easily search for candidates based on specific skills. This can save time and effort, as HR professionals can quickly identify and reach out to candidates who have the skills needed for a particular job.

## Backend
The Hiring app's backend is built using Java Spring Boot and uses REST API for communication.The Hiring app's backend uses an H2 In-Memory database for quick development and testing.

## Web Frontend
The web frontend of my Hiring app is developed using React with Typescript.The app also utilizes the Mantine library, which provided me a set of reusable React components for fast UI development.

## Testing
The Hiring app has a comprehensive testing approach that includes Junit5 services and controllers unit tests covering all the app's features. The testing process is facilitated through the use of Mockito. 

The Hiring app utilizes Swagger, which is implemented for faster testing of the app's REST APIs. With Swagger, developers can easily test the APIs and ensure that they function as intended, resulting in a more efficient development process.
